Description: Ranking of Alternatives through Functional mapping of criterion sub-intervals into a Single Interval Method is designed to perform multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM), developed by Mališa Žižovic in 2020 (<doi:10.3390/math8061015>). 
              It calculates the final sorted rankings based on a decision matrix where rows represent alternatives 
              and columns represent criteria. The method uses:
              - A numeric vector of weights for each criterion (the sum of weights must be 1).
              - A numeric vector of ideal values for each criterion.
              - A numeric vector of anti-ideal values for each criterion.
              - Numeric values representing the extent to which the ideal value is preferred over the anti-ideal value, 
                and the extent to which the anti-ideal value is considered worse.
              The function standardizes the decision matrix, normalizes the data, applies weights, and returns the 
              final sorted rankings.
